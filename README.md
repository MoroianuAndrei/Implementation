# 📚 Data Structures Implementation: List, Forward List & Queue

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains C++ implementations of three fundamental data structures:
- **List**: A doubly linked list that allows dynamic operations such as insertion, deletion, and element access.
- **Forward List**: A singly linked list optimized for fast insertion and deletion at the beginning.
- **Queue**: A queue following the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle for processing elements.

These implementations were developed using Visual Studio and are organized into separate solutions for easy testing and understanding of each structure.

## 🛠️ Features
### **🔹 List (Doubly Linked List)**
- Insert and delete elements at the beginning, end, or arbitrary positions.
- Quickly access the first and last elements.
- Bidirectional traversal of elements.

### **🔹 Forward List (Singly Linked List)**
- Simple structure for fast data manipulation.
- Efficient insertion and deletion at the beginning.
- Unidirectional traversal.

### **🔹 Queue**
- Implements a FIFO-based queue.
- Constant-time insertion (enqueue) and deletion (dequeue).
- Easy-to-use for managing data flow.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **C++** for implementation.
